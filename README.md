# Deep-Learning-project
DTU deep learning project linked to master thesis about analysis of brain white matter

During the semester I worked on the python files (.py)

For the hand in I have created notebooks so that my results (graphs) can be seen. I suggest the reader to use the notebooks.


THE FILES

- Network1 and NW1: is the implementation of my first approach, which is purely deeplearning
- Network2 and NW2: is the implementation of the deep learning network applied after NNLS (Approach 2)
- Network3 and NW3: uses the same approach as 2, but does not use a split

- getDataW and gen_synthetic_data_new: files to generate synthetic data (based on code by Gaetan Rensonnet at UCLouvain and EPFL)

THE DATA: 
In the python files, I used the data from large dictionnaries or generated it myself with help functions 
Since the dictionary is very large, I tried to put only the data that is needed in some pickle files 
(these are the ones used in the notebooks).
Unfortunately even the pickle files don't fit on this github.
